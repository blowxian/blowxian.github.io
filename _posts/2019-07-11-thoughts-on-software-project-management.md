### The Current State of Project Management

After decades of rapid growth, the software industry remains remarkably young compared to established sectors like real estate or finance. While we've made tremendous progress in shipping features and hitting deadlines, the discipline of project management hasn't matured at the same pace.

During my time at major tech companies, I observed a common pattern: project management roles often devolved into information gathering rather than actual "management." The reasons are complex — limited authority, team dynamics, organizational culture — but they all point to an industry that hasn't fully developed this capability.

At smaller teams, the situation is even more challenging. Without dedicated PM resources, management responsibilities get distributed haphazardly.

### The True Value of Project Management

The 996 backlash (the controversy around 9am-9pm, 6-day work weeks) wasn't just about work culture — it was a symptom of deeper structural issues.

During the growth era, companies could offer high salaries and equity to compensate for grueling hours. But as the industry matures and competition intensifies, that equation no longer balances. Companies now face both increased competition AND declining individual ROI.

This is where project management becomes critical. Good PM practices can dramatically improve both individual and team productivity **without** additional financial investment. In a resource-constrained environment, that's invaluable.

### Key Dimensions of Effective Project Management

The diagram above outlines the key areas a project manager should master. Even if some responsibilities are shared with other roles, a PM must maintain visibility across all dimensions to effectively guide a project to success.

The best project managers I've worked with share one trait: they understand both the technical and human elements of software development. They know when to push and when to protect their teams.
